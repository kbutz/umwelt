      "notes": "Sea cucumbers possess mechanoreceptors to detect tactile stimuli and pressure changes in their environment. Given the description of body wall tables, it is likely these structures play a role in mechanosensation, potentially detecting substrate vibrations or water currents. This is inferred as a basic sensory capability for navigating the benthic environment.",
