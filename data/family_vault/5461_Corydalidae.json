      "notes": "Adults have long filamentous antennae, and male fishflies have feathered antennae, which are likely used for detecting air currents and vibrations. Larvae are aquatic and possess strong mandibles, suggesting the presence of mechanoreceptors for prey detection and manipulation. The presence of the cylinder-shaped fourth tarsal segment suggests tactile sensation capabilities.",
