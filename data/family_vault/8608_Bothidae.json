Specific visual capabilities like color vision or UV sensitivity are unknown, but the presence of eyes suggests a functional visual system.",

This is inferred, but a common trait for fish and essential for awareness in their environment. Additionally, the presence of spines on the snout and near the eyes might function in sensing the immediate surroundings.",
