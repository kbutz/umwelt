They have four pairs of eyes: a principal pair that is movable, and three fixed secondary pairs. The anterior median eyes are particularly large. Posterior median eyes are vestigial in many species but can detect motion. Posterior lateral eyes (PLEs) are wide-angle motion detectors. Anterior lateral eyes (ALEs) have the best visual acuity of the secondary eyes.",
