      "notes": "Octopuses have well-developed eyes for underwater vision, likely adapted for detecting contrast and movement. Though specific research for Enteroctopodidae is limited, vision is a defining feature of octopuses in general. Depth perception is likely present, aiding in hunting and navigation.",

      "notes": "Octopuses use chemoreceptors on their suckers and skin to 'taste' their environment. This allows them to identify prey and navigate chemical gradients in the water. Given the habitat of *Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis* near hydrothermal vents, detection of specific chemicals is likely important.",

The suckers are especially important for tactile exploration and manipulation. The double rows of suckers in *Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis* implies an adaptation that relies on the coordination and sensitivity of their arms.",
