    "vision": {
      "presence": "common",
      "notes": "Presbyornithids were birds, and as such, vision was likely a primary sense. Given their morphology, similar to ducks and geese, they likely had good visual acuity for spotting food and navigating their environment. No specific visual adaptations are mentioned, so we assume a generalized avian visual system.",

      "notes": "As birds, presbyornithids likely possessed a well-developed sense of hearing for communication, predator detection, and environmental awareness. While specific auditory adaptations are not detailed in the text, it can be inferred that they used hearing for social interactions and survival.",

This sense would have been crucial for activities such as foraging, nesting, and social interactions. The bill, similar to that of a duck, would likely have been sensitive to touch for filter feeding.",
