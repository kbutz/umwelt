      "notes": "Likely plays a role in prey detection and navigation in freshwater habitats. Given that they are ray-finned fish, vision is likely a key sense, although specific visual capabilities are not detailed in the provided context. However, the reliance of exotic salmonids on vision to predate on galaxiids supports the importance of vision for both predator and prey.",
